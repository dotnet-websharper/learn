  WebSharper on the server - using sitelets and interoperating with other web
  frameworks.

# Overview

WebSharper provides its own abstraction for server-side content via **sitelets**, in addition to readily plugging into the ASP.NET pipeline and other micro web frameworks such as Giraffe or Saturn.

Learn about constructing server-side HTML:

{% page-ref page="html.md" %}

Learn about sitelets and how they make developing microservices and client-server applications super-easy and type safe:

{% page-ref page="sitelets/" %}
